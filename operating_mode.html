     <h1>Research center operating mode</h1>
     <p>Manaty Research Center allows Researchers to participate in Research Projects and get financed by the Scientific commitee.<p>
     
     <h2>Researchers</h2>
     <p>Researchers are individuals that are working, full or part time, on one or more Research Projects.<br/>
       They work openly by committing their work on public git repositories or drives.<br/>
       They regularily participate to webinars to present their studies and research.<br/>
     </p>
     <p>To become a Manaty Researcher, send a request on <a href="https://discord.gg/D5cNAWc">discord</a>.</p>

     <h2>Projects</h2>
     <p>Projects are entities:
      <ul>
        <li>Created and led by a project leader.</li>
        <li>Constituted of Researchers.</li>
        <li>Financed and supervised by the Scientific Commitee</li>
      </ul>      
     </p>
     <p>
       In order to start a project a researcher creates a document describing the subject or research, its minimal budget an minimal delay.<br/>
       If the project is a sub-project of another project then it is submitted for approval to the project leader of the parent project,
       else it is submitted for approval to the Scientific Commitee.
     </p>
     <p>
       Once accepted, the project lead can receive funds.<br/>
       The funds, registered on the project account, are spent by the project lead.<br/>
       Each expense is associated to an invoice that is accepted and paid by Manaty.<br/>
       An expense can only be made if its amount is lower than the project account balance.<br/>
       Any member of the Scientific Comitee can see the list of expenses. 
     <p/>
     <p>
       The project lead commits to organize recorded video webinars every month.</br>
       The total amount of time of those monthly video must be at least the amount financed by the Scientific Commitee.</br>
       The project lead commits to answer monthly the questions sent by the scientific commitee.<br/>
       The scientific comitee can decide at any moment to stop a project and reimburse the remaining funds.<br/>
       In case the project lead do not fulfill its obligations.
     <p/>

     <h2>Scientific commitee</h2>
     <p>
       The scientific commitee is composed of all individuals and organizations that finance the research projects.<br/>
       It decides with a simple majority of expressed composed votes :
       <ul>
         <li>[D1] Whether an individual is accepted as a researcher.</li>
         <li>[D2] Whether a project (not attached to another project) is accepted.</li>
         <li>[D3] If a project need to be stopped.</li>
       </ul>
     </p>
     <p>
       Any individual or company that finance a research project is allowed to join the scientific project.<br/>
       He can vote directly any decision or delegate his vote to another member (provided this later accepts), potentially for a limited time and limited scope (D1, D2 or D3).
     </p>
     <p> To finance a project, the individual send request on <a href="https://discord.gg/D5cNAWc">discord</a>.<br/>
         He will then receive a proposal from Manaty, and if accepted, an invoice.<br/>
         The service sold correspond to a certain amount of minutes of video webinar to be performed by the project lead.<br/>
         The current rate is 100eur per minute.<br/>
