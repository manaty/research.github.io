        <li>Constituted of Researchers.</li>
        <li>Financed and supervised by the Scientific Commitee</li>
      </ul>      
     </p>
     <p>
       In order to start a project a researcher creates a document describing the subject or research, its minimal budget an minimal delay.<br/>
       If the project is a sub-project of another project then it is submitted for approval to the project leader of the parent project,
       else it is submitted for approval to the Scientific Commitee.

     <p>
       Once accepted, the project lead can receive funds.<br/>
       The funds, registered on the project account, are spent by the project lead.<br/>
       Each expense is associated to an invoice that is paid by Manaty.<br/>
       Invoice can only be made to providers accepted by Manaty.<br/>
       An expense can only be made if its amount is lower than the project account balance.<br/>
       Any member of the Scientific Comitee can see the list of expenses. 
     <p/>
     <p>
       The project lead commits to realize recorded video webinars every month.</br>
       The total amount of time of those monthly video must be at least the amount financed by the Scientific Commitee.</br>
